    <h2>Secret History</h2>
    <p>
        Dominion Legends was originally going to feature a new concept called <i class="b">Conquer cards</i>. These cards would have allowed you and 1 other player of your choice to fight a battle usually involving revealing cards for different benefits. These were later scrapped, although we kept <i class="b">Bribe</i> and made it into a basic <i class="b">Action</i> card. We also toyed with the idea of bringing <i class="b">Durations</i> into the set, and I can recall <i class="b">Fief Village</i> also being a Duration. We also thought of making the <i class="b">Dragons</i> into a <i class="b">Knight</i> / <i class="b">Castle</i> like pile, but they never had much cohesion. Overall, there are a few cards I would go back and fix, I kept messing around with <i class="b">Blank Slate</i> and <i class="b">Warlock</i>, but it isn't wort it to create a <i class="b">2E</i> for this set. <i class="b">Blank Slate</i> in particularwas originally planned to be a card that would remove all your <img src="./other/debt.png" alt="Debt"> when you gained it. It was going to also cost <img src="./other/debt.png" alt="Debt">, but I realized that you can't buy a card with <img src="./other/debt.png" alt="Debt"> when you have <img src="./other/debt.png" alt="Debt">. So I had to scrap that version of <i class="b">Blank Slate</i>. <br><br>
        While I was working on <i class="b">Loose Change</i> it was suggested to me that the art would be better suited in <i class="b">Dragon's Hoard</i>, but at that point <i class="b">Loose Change</i> was so cemented in my mind I couldn't seperate the art from the name. Also while I was working on <i class="b">Fief Village</i> it was originally going to be a <i class="b">Duration</i> that only cost  <img src="./other/3.png" alt="$3">. This was a silly mistake because it was only ever meant to say "While this is in play", and not "Until the start of your next turn". Both of these do the same but the former had much more precedent.<br><br>
        The first iteration of <i class="b">Fief Village</i> I made said +2 Actions, You may draw as many cards as you want, as many as you draw +<img src="./other/debt.png" alt="Debt"/>. Everyone else realized that that was insanely broken because if you draw your whole deck, chances are you should be able to easily pay the debt off. Think of <i class="b">Mountain Pass</i>, Fief was also broken by only consting <img src="./other/4.png" alt="4">.<br><br>
        <i class="b">Dragon</i>, one of the cards we eventually removed, was a primary concept of the set and would have been gained by other cards and then on play would have returned itself to its <i class="b">Supply pile</i> we had in mind <i class="b">Madman</i>, and <i class="b">Horses</i> when we were originally planning that concept. Overall the Dragons as a group were too overpowerd, but their main feature of Trashing opponents cards bled into <i class="b">Warlock</i>. <br><br>
        <i class="b">Dueling Arena</i> was another card that made its debut in the original <i class="b">Conquer</i> listing. As a Conquer it was known as <i class="b">Duel</i>, The art was the only thing that stayed from the original and even the name was modified. All the conquers together were either too powerful or had to much change built in so we scrapped them. <br><br>
        <i class="b">Evil Dragon</i> was a <img src="./other/7.png" alt="7">* cost card that was the last of the <i class="b">Dragon</i> cards that were not in the <i class="b">Supply</i>. This accompanied a change in <i class="b">Dragon</i> where it also was not in the <i class="b">Supply</i>. Toghether these cards would have formed the basis for a full <i class="b">Dragon</i> band of cards but we eventually trannsitioned away from a set with new elements and one with <i class="b">Durations</i>.
